sound 1: looping 3d is attatched to a block representing a cauldron
sound 2: is a bell soound that activates when walking into the shop
sound 3: is an ambient 2D sound

Added four reverb areas.
1. is set to living room sound. This is the store front. I felt that a nice cushy store front would have a mellow echo
2. I created two garden reverb sound areas set to forest. This part of the building has plants which I felt would give it a different echo than the store.
3. I created a third area (fourth reverb zone) because I felt that this part of the building would be less cozy as things are dead
    "sterile" feeling, and medicial themed. 
Because of the reverb zones I am considering texturing the floors in each room slightly different to add to the reverb effect logic. :)
